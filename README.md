## Image Classification Model Using Deep Learning 
**Image Classification** <br>
The task of identifying what an image represents is called image classification. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images. <br>
**Deep Learning**
It is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data.


## Model Overview
- This model is train to recognize photos representing two different human facial expressions : Happy and sad. <br>
- To train this model data is collected from google url of Happy and Sad people with facial expressions.
- Images  with these four extensions are only included to train the model - ["jpg","jpeg","bmp","png"]

## Model Building Steps
1. Required Dependencies installation <br>
   Install dependencies with pip command inside jupyter notebook
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib
